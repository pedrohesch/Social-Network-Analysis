# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This is a work of social network analysis - Twitter. The idea was to generate some information from sentiment analysis. We have used as Twitter search terms, sports brands related to Tennis sport (one of the author's hobbies). Firstly, a visualization was generated through the wordcloud format and then attributed positive and negative scores to the tweets for a classification and comparison between the marks.

In this repositorie you will find:

1- Twitter_Analysis_en.R = The R code for the task.

2- Twitter_Analysis_en_Report.pdf = A complete report with the code run, comments and results.

3- Twitter_Analysis_en.Rmd = The R Mardown file to create the pdf report.
